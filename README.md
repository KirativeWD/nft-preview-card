## My process

This was my first time applying ::before and/or ::after to a project (as I was too uncomfortable doing so beforehand). After doing some personal studying, I decided these pseudo-elements would not be too intimidating and gave them a shot with the two small symbolsâ€”though I am unsure of their proper usage when it comes to images (as I would have done the same with the avatar image otherwise). Overall, I am happy with how this turned out.
